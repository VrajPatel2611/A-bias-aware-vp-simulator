"""
The append-only event log (BUILD_PLAN T-013, ADR-0003).

Two operations and no others. `session_events` carries the
`session_events_append_only` trigger (migration 010), which refuses every
UPDATE and DELETE at the database — so "append-only" is not a description of
how this module happens to be written, it is a property nothing in the
application can violate.

**On `seq` and the retry.** `DATA_MODEL` §6.2 makes `UNIQUE (session_id, seq)`
the concurrency control:

> Two simultaneous requests computing the same next sequence number will
> collide, and one fails cleanly rather than silently interleaving. The
> application retries with a fresh sequence.

The trap is what a collision does to the transaction. In PostgreSQL a unique
violation aborts **the whole transaction**, not just the statement: every
subsequent command fails with *"current transaction is aborted"*. A naive
`try / except / retry` therefore turns one collision into a dead scope, and it
looks correct in every single-threaded test.

So the INSERT runs inside a SAVEPOINT (`begin_nested`). A violation rolls back
to the savepoint, the surrounding transaction survives, and the retry computes
a fresh `max(seq) + 1`. Retrying the whole scope would work too, but would also
redo whatever else the caller had already done in that unit of work.

The alternative -- `pg_advisory_xact_lock` per session, which removes the race
entirely -- was rejected: BUILD_PLAN specifies the retry, and a lock adds a
failure mode (one stuck transaction blocks every append for that session) that
a retry does not have.
