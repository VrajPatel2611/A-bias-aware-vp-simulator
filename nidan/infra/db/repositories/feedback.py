"""
Stored feedback prose (BUILD_PLAN T-013).

**Only the prose is stored.** Every flag, score, verdict and scorecard on the
feedback screen is recomputed from the event log when the page is rendered —
they are deterministic functions of what the learner did, so storing them would
be storing a cache that can silently disagree with the log it came from.

The lines here are the one part that cannot be recomputed: a language model
wrote them, at a temperature, on a day. Replaying the same events would produce
different words. That asymmetry is exactly `ADR-0005` — the model writes prose
and never marks — turned into a storage decision, and it is why `/feedback`
can be re-opened a year later and still show the same reasoning next to the
same words.

`generator` records whether the model or the deterministic fallback produced
them (`infra/feedback.py`). The fallback fires on a timeout or a rate limit,
silently and by design, so this column is the only durable evidence of how
often the model was actually unavailable.
