T-003 · Case content invariants C-1 … C-7 (DATA_MODEL §8.1).

Clinical case content is data, not code, so nothing in the type system or the
test suite catches a malformed case. These seven checks are that safety net.

C-4 is why this file exists. Anchor keywords overlapping contradictory clues is
the defect that held the confirmation-bias detector at 14% sensitivity, and it
is invisible on inspection: the terms look unrelated until you notice that the
detector matches by substring, so the anchor keyword "heart" matches a learner
asking about "heartburn" — the exact opposite line of enquiry.

Every test is parametrised per case so a failure names the case, and every
assertion message names the offending terms. A failure you have to go hunting
for is a failure that gets ignored.
