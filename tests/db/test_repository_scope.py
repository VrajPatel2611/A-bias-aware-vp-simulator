T-012 acceptance criterion 2: the policies deny the application, not just a
hand-written psql session.

`test_rls.py` (T-010) proved the policies are correctly written, using a
purpose-built `rls_tester` role. It could not prove anything about the
application, which did not exist yet. These tests go through `repo_scope` --
the real engine, the real pool, the real `SET LOCAL ROLE` -- because the failure
this guards against is not a wrong policy. It is a correct policy that never
applies, which looks exactly like a working system until two users share it.

    The reason `base.assume` uses `SET LOCAL ROLE` and `set_config(..., true)`
    rather than the plain forms.

    Plain `SET` is transactional but not transaction-*scoped*: once the
    transaction commits, the role and the claim persist for the life of the
    connection -- and a pooled connection is handed to whichever request asks
    next. SQLAlchemy's pool resets it with ROLLBACK, which does not undo a
    committed SET.

    Today nothing exploits that, because every scope calls `assume` and
    overwrites the stale values before running a query. That is a thin
    guarantee to rest tenant isolation on: it holds only while no code ever
    touches a pooled connection outside a scope, and it fails silently, in
    production, under load, the first time one does. So the property tested
    here is the durable one -- **a connection carries nothing about its last
    user when it is returned** -- rather than the one that happens to be
    unobservable at this moment.

    This test was written the other way round first, asserting that a second
    scope could not see the first's rows. It passed against plain `SET` too,
