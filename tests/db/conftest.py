"""
Database fixtures (BUILD_PLAN T-010).

A real PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector in a container, migrated from scratch. Not
SQLite, not a mock: every guarantee these tests check — partial unique indexes,
CHECK constraints, append-only triggers, the publication gate, RLS — is a
PostgreSQL feature. Testing them anywhere else would test nothing.

The container starts once per session and each test runs inside a transaction
that is rolled back, so tests neither wait for 16 migrations nor see each
other's rows.
