"""
T-011 · openapi.yaml is valid, and honest about the contract.

This file is what the frontend generates its client from (sync point S-1), so
an error here costs Yogesh rework rather than costing us a red test. These
checks are cheap and the failure mode is expensive.

Two of them guard product guarantees rather than syntax: assessment state must
not be exposed during a consultation, and bias vocabulary must not appear in
any response. Those are CT-1, CT-2 and CT-5 in API_CONTRACT §11, and the schema
is where they are easiest to break by accident.
