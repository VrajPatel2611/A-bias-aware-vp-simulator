Shared fixtures (BUILD_PLAN T-002).

The `_no_real_llm` fixture below is autouse: it applies to every test in the
suite whether the test asks for it or not. That is deliberate — criterion 1 is
that *no test makes a network call*, and a guarantee that depends on each test
author remembering to opt in is not a guarantee.
